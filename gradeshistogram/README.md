# Grades Histogram
The assignment description can be found [here](https://edu.dmst.aueb.gr/pluginfile.php/19415/mod_resource/content/1/Lab-Assignment-2.pdf). In detail, the executable .jar takes a path as a parameter and creates a histogram of the grades of the path's file.

### Prerequisites
1. A text file that strictly contains one grade in every line.

In order to create the grades histogram, you must have firstly implemented the [building of the project](https://github.com/stef4k/Software-Engineering-Lab-Assignments/blob/development/README.md) (Building section)

## Histogram Creation
The produced jar is located in the target directory and can be executed as following:

   `java -jar <jarpath> <textfilepath>`

where _jarpath_ is the location of the downloaded .jar file, and _textfilepath_ is the location of the text file.
